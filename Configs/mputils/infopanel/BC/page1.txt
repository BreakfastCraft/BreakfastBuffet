Welcome to Breakfast Buffet LTS

This pack was put together by the BC team as a long term pack. The purpose is to have a server to play on, that won't reset until a set date. 


What you can expect:

-The world will reset on August 31th 2019
-We will try our best to keep the server running. 
-World backup will be kept


if you have issues with the pack, file an issue at our github. https://github.com/BreakfastCraft/BreakfastBuffet/issues
